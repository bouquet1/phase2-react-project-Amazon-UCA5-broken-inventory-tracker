To start using React Router, we need to install react-router-dom:

```
$ npm install
$ npm install react-router-dom@5
```

Note: make sure to include @5 at the end of the install command to install React Router version 5 instead of version 6.

handle the GET recipes - useState recipes to fetch the recipes

I didn't add lunch/ dinner bc my app has met MVP with using only breakfastRecipe
but I have lunch and dinner fetch rewuests and some other uncommented parts such as button 'add a new recipe'inside AddRecipeForm component because I wanna continue to improve this app. I want that Add a new recipe button in AddRecipeForm comp to be toggled and the form be visible when the button clicked. I want to create Breakfast Recipes/ Lunch Recipes/ Dinner Recipes to be 3 buttons to navigate between them under Meal Prep List. I want to add many more things like that. Honestly, I was working for a different project idea for this assignment but I realized it is too advance for me at this phase and it took me some time to switch back from that project idea to a new project idea. When I finally come up this Meal Prep Asistant app idea it was already too late. So to meet the deadline I did MVP and I will continue to built my app and make it fucntional, aesthetic, and ready before graduation hoping to impress my new employee.
