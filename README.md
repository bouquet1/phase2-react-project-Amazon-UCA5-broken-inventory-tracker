To start using React Router, we need to install react-router-dom:

```
$ npm install
$ npm install react-router-dom@5
$ npm start

```

Note: make sure to include @5 at the end of the install command to install React Router version 5 instead of version 6.

Easy Recipes with 5 Ingredients or Less

I created my own json file which I emjoy doing it a lot

    I separeted AddIngredientsForm to have a clean data for ingredients recipe and avoid having many input boxes for this purpose. I also wanted user to see as a list below the input to easier manipulation. I wanna do it for the AddFormREcipe later.

I copied the file to work on PATCH separately. I need to update review accordongly.
RecipeDetails component as a child of AddRecipeForm will allow me to display the recipe details in a non-edit mode initially, and then switch to an edit mode when the user clicks the "Edit Recipe" button. This way, I can provide a seamless user experience for updating the recipe details.
